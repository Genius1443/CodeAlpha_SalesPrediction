# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning: Comprehensive Analysis
This project delivers a complete end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting sales based on advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper platforms. The analysis reveals critical insights about advertising effectiveness and provides actionable recommendations for optimizing marketing budget allocation.

# Executive Summary
The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best-performing model with 98.1% accuracy (R² = 0.982) and minimal prediction error (RMSE = 0.76). Analysis of 200 advertising campaigns revealed that TV advertising drives the majority of sales impact with 78.2% correlation, while newspaper advertising shows minimal return on investment. The optimized budget allocation strategy can potentially increase sales by 24.3% through strategic reallocation of advertising spend.

Dataset Analysis and Data Preparation
The advertising dataset comprises 200 records tracking sales performance across three advertising channels. Initial data exploration revealed a clean dataset with no missing values or duplicates.

# Machine Learning Model Development
Three models were developed: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with R² = 0.9815 and RMSE = 0.76.

# Business Recommendations
Increase TV spend by 40% and Radio by 30%, reduce Newspaper by 50%.
Implement continuous performance monitoring.
Conduct A/B testing to validate results.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can optimize advertising strategies and improve sales forecasting accuracy.
